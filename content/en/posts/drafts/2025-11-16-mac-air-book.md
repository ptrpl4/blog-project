# I spent some time with MacBook Air, and that is what I want to say

`15‑inch, M4, 2025`

## Why 15

I never used such a big laptop before. You definitely see the difference and it is noticeable before you open the lid. It's not huge, but it's bigger than you expect. You will notice it when you place it on the table or on your knees, but you can't say it gives you something in exchange.  
You have a bigger screen, but it will be hard to tell exactly how it helps. Yes, for some specific cases you can have the same app more visible or accessible. It definitely will be noted if your previous laptop had this particular issue in a particular case, and you couldn't fix it in some other way. And yes, I remember placing Bsky and Twitter in split view and it was pretty ok. But on another laptop with a smaller screen I probably wouldn't even try to do this; I will try to find another way.

So yeah, as I see it - a big screen is an advantage for particular cases when there is only one option to make your setup better and expand the workspace.

## Why not

### Only 2 USB

It's not about 15‑inch; it's about Air in general. But with 13‑inch I at least could think that this decision was made based on technical and physical limitations - “there was no another way to place one more port, or even move existing ports on different sides.” Apple didn't solve it even for the big model, so it's a political gesture: “You’re not pro, we will humiliate you.” And this is the thing that I met on the first day I used a Mac. I needed to connect a cable. I had the cable on the right, the port on the left, and I had to move the Mac to the center of the table to be able to connect it. As a result, I couldn't use it for a while.

### Size

It's big. Yes, not heavy (my Mac Pro 14 is heavier) but still you can't use it like a small device. If it's on the table, it's only on the table (of course, it's not so bad, and probably you already used big Air or Pro models - you will disagree, but for me it was definitely a disadvantage).

## Gaming?

Yes, but why.

## Screen?

Can't say anything here. Yes, it's smaller than Pro 14 (obviously). But it's hard to say that it bothers you with anything. Just feels compact, not extremely small.

120Hz?

Can't say anything. Maybe in gaming it will be noticeable. But for me 120Hz on my iPhone is barely noticeable too, so it is based on how you usually feel. The overall brightness feels not so dimmable. Looks like on the Pro model you could click it once and the changes will be less noticeable. And also the peak brightness is not so bright. Probably after some time outside it will be noticeable, but still can't name it as a problem.

## M4 = fast macOS?

Ok, I had (and still have and use) a Mac with M1Pro. It was from 2021. And now I open Air with M4 and see no difference.

1. Both Macs are still very fast. I can't pick many tasks when I have to wait long on M1Pro. On M4 it happens slightly faster.
2. Things that were slow are still slow. And it's macOS, not the processor. When you open Settings, especially some weird sections buried under dozens of internal sections. Or easier - using iCloud settings (yes, I do know that it needs to fetch some data from Apple servers. But is it 100MB? No? Then why am I waiting seconds? Do they have SLA? Does it match the SLA? Not sure.) And this is the separate part - you paid for it, a bunch of pesos. Using it. And in the end it's big. And it is slow. You couldn't buy M1Pro with a replaced battery. What is it all about?

## What about 13‑inch?

And one more small update. To the picture we can also add Air 13 with M2, that I am using right now to finish this text. And what I want to say - (for me, of course) it's much friendlier than the 15‑inch big brother. Maybe with a smaller size you can feel more control, or maybe I didn't expect anything from it - but I like it. Yes, it contains all the illnesses of Air that I described earlier. But it looks like I didn't expect anything from it (I just took it to send to Apple Store, but decided to use it for a while).

It is small. Yes, maybe it sounds the same as “it's big” but just another word, but it looks like it doesn't bother you with anything. If you want to use it - use it, if you want to keep it in a backpack - probably you won't even notice that it's inside.

## Ending

For me it was just an experiment I could do, and I got pretty interesting results. 14‑inch for me is a cap for a laptop. For day‑to‑day work I still have to use Pro14. And I'm okay with that - HDMI, card reader, ports on both sides - it calls comfort. But if I had to travel a lot and had only Air 13 (with any M processor) - it will be a successor for this trip. I even think - maybe to take it with me on a future trip and check out how it will be.
