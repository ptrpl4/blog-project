## What's Good Here
- Visual style. You want to examine the locations and characters, and the "living drawing" style resonates well with the plot
- The world. We're in the 16th century. We're an artist in a small town, working at an abbey. We have a job, need to eat and chat with neighbors at meals, need to sleep, and despite being the 16th century, time management was already a relevant discipline back then
- The plot. The story smoothly introduces us to the world, characters, and customs, showing that you can spend more time to get more information or allows you to rush to the nearest marked place on the map
- Characters. You will hate, love, forgive, and hate again many of them. Living dialogues allow you to get close to people and follow the lives of monks, peasants, and their children

## What's Bad Here
- Linearity. The game tries to show that decisions really affect the plot, but in reality, these are just small differences in character dialogue. It seemed that in such conditions, when the game's foundation is its text and story development, the consequences of decisions could be turned into separate plot branches with different endings
- The reveal. I had to replay the first act twice. The second time, I already had a clear idea of who was to blame and how the plot would unfold. Everything was justified
- Few rewards for exploration. The game allows you to visit all locations on the map at any time and start a dialogue with all available characters. Sometimes they provide useful information or even develop the plot or help with side quests. Most of the time, however, no one wants to talk to the hero, but there's no indication other than the main quest marker on the map - the hero has to either ignore all the "unimportant" ones or spend each new time segment wandering through a list of 30 different places and "clicking" NPCs for useful news. It seems this problem could be fixed by fast travel or reducing the number of available locations (or an icon "this character has new lines"). But alas
