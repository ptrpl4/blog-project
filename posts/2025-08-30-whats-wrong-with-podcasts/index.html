First of all what is podcast? btw - there is an old (6 years already) article that still fully correct about it (rus) https://beardycast.com/article/chto-takoe-podkasty/\nMain idea here - podcast is anything (now) that you call podcast. I would like something more straidforward like - podcast must be accesible via xml file - and that means that should be server that keeps this xml - author somehow updating it along with new episodes that link to some mp3 (or aac, ok) files on this server - and user can play it via any of many podcats players. But now it could be upload on youtube, or spotify. It could be paid! And it needs to verify that you can have access to it. - Yes now its getting harder. I can uderstand idea to place podcast whathewer you wanted and ask money for it. But its just makes the whole idea more complicated.\nOk, what is wrong with apps? There is plenty of it, an they all working (i hope) - but it also means that this app takes some of user attention.\nOk, what is wrong in general? no strict structure\nin description in site link in chapters in cover and chapter cover where to comment it\nand where auhthor is expecting to see comments? In the end I still think that podcast as format - perfect for feeling that you in some discussion with clever (hope) people. But the core idea of decetralisation makes harder to find and communicate with you. But maybe those who not addind links to website or place where you can send a comment just don’t need it at all.
